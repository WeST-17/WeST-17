  <h2>About Me!</h2>
  <div align="left">
    During the day I attend Austin Community College as a Software Development/Computer Programming major. Previously, I was a Transportation Planner. I decided to pivot in my career to find different outlet for learning and creativity.
    <br><br>
    Still dedicated to urban mobility and connectivity, and wanted to find a different way to improve and connect people and communities. I'm currently building Wo Shi Cat, a Chinese and Asian inspired apparel brand, as a web developer and partner!
