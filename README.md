  <h2>About Me!</h2>
  <div>
    I'm Wes! A software developer in training who is dedicated about building community through tech. Looking to focus on full stack development.
  
During the day I attend Austin Community College as a Software Development/Computer Programming major. Previously, I was a Transportation Planner. Still dedicated to urban mobility and connectivity, and wanted to find a different way to improve and connect people and communities. Currently at Warby Parker, advising people on glasses styling and vision needs.
  
Elsewhere, you can find me playing volleyball and/or at a local coffee or bubble tea shop! or Traveling. Eating. Etc.
